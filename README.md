# qior: Quantum Input Output Relations
A python package for the numerical evaluation of the final state resulting of the application of linear input-output relations on arbitrary initial quantum states.

## Instalation
This package is pip-installable

## Dependencies
[qutip](qutip.org)

## Use
There are two ways to use this module.

The user may import it like any other module and use the functions and classes therein to create linear input-output relations and compute the output state for arbitrary input density matrices.

The second way to use the module is to execute it as "python -m qior" after installation. The module will copy a series of scripts named "exampleX.py" that showcase and document the module features. They are executed with "python exampleX.py" on the directory "python -m qior" was executed.
